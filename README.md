# ECG-Classification
This project focuses on classifying raw ECG time series into one of four heart rhythm classes. Each ECG signal is a variable-length waveform sampled at 300 Hz, and the final model predicts the underlying heart rhythm directly from the processed signal.

The first stage of the pipeline focuses on transforming raw ECG waveforms into a rich and structured representation of each signal. Each ECG recording is a 1D time series sampled at 300 Hz and is first cleaned and standardized. The signal is denoised using the ecg_clean method from NeuroKit2. R-peaks are identified using the Engzee segmentation algorithm, and heartbeats are segmented accordingly.

From the denoised signals, a large set of features is extracted, combining time-domain, frequency-domain, morphological, and non-linear descriptors. These include basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis), Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, complexity), and heart rate variability (HRV) features computed from RR intervals. Signals with fewer than 2 seconds of valid data are discarded. After feature extraction, columns with more than 20% missing values are dropped, and all remaining missing or infinite values are imputed using an IterativeImputer with 15 nearest features and a maximum of 50 iterations. The dataset is then standardized using StandardScaler, and dimensionality is reduced using SelectKBest to retain the 30 most informative features.

The core classifier is an XGBoost model (XGBClassifier), which is optimized using a RandomizedSearchCV strategy across 20 configurations. The hyperparameter search explores various values for learning rate, tree depth, subsample ratio, and column subsample ratio, using 3-fold cross-validation and accuracy as the scoring metric. Once the best configuration is selected, the model is wrapped in a BaggingClassifier with 150 estimators to increase stability and reduce variance.
